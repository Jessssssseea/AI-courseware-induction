I ’m more than glad to tell you there will be a poster e xhibition with the theme of Man and Nature in our school. Knowing that you are quite interested in this topic, I am writing to invite you to come to admire it with me. The exhibition, whose aim is to arouse the students ’ awareness of the importance of protecting nature, will take place in the school hall from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. this Saturday. All of the posters have been designed by the students, who creatively use a wide variety of images to explore the relationship between humans and nature. Not only do th e posters show the students ’ creativity, but also they make the viewers more aware of the fact that only when we exist in harmony with nature, can we stop being a threat to our planet. I am sure it will be an unforgettable experience for us. I would be del ighted if you could accept the invitation. Looking forward to your earliest reply. Yours, Li Hua
